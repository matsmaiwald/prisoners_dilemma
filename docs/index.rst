Welcome to PrisonersDilemma's documentation!
============================================

PrisonersDilemma is a simple package to run tournaments in which agents play repeated games
of prisoners_dilemma against each other. After each round, players are ranked by their score for
the round and the bottom half of players are eliminated.
